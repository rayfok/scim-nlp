{"text": "We formulate the novel interaction of iteratively generating and refining sketches with text instructions and present a web-deployable implementation of Scones to support this interaction.", "label": "Contribution"}
{"text": "We contribute a scene composition proposer, a component of our system that takes a novel approach in creating and editing scenes of objects using natural language. It adapts a recent neural network architecture and improves state-of-the-art performance on the scene modification task.", "label": "Contribution"}
{"text": "We introduce a novel method for specifying high-level scene semantics within individual object sketches by conditioning sketch generation with mask outlines of target sketches.", "label": "Contribution"}
{"text": "First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate the design of interactive machine learning system for sound classification.", "label": "Contribution"}
{"text": "We propose and examine a novel interactive framework for training sound classification models from a large amount of unlabeled samples.", "label": "Contribution"}
{"text": "Second, we provide a detailed analysis of user behaviors and questionnaires based on the user study, and clarify how novice users perform the interactive sound classification task and how each visualization influences the interactions.", "label": "Contribution"}
{"text": "Finally, based on the analysis, we discuss design implications for interactive sound recognition GUIs.", "label": "Contribution"}
{"text": "This context is both timely and relevant: timely, because many organizations are currently faced with the problem of how to migrate complex, legacy applications to the cloud when they do not necessarily have the resources or expertise to do so", "label": "NotContribution"}
{"text": "The UX variants were designed to resemble a simple programming environment with two code panes: a “source” pane on the left for input code, and a “target” pane on the right for the code output by the NMT model.", "label": "NotContribution"}
{"text": "Participants responded positively to the confidence highlights (Figure 1B) and the alternate translations (Figure 1C) and felt that both views were helpful.", "label": "NotContribution"}
{"text": "Generative AI techniques are enabling new forms of human-AI co-creation.", "label": "NotContribution"}
{"text": "Participants identified many opportunities for generative models to aid the overall application modernization workflow of building understanding, performing the migration, and reviewing & testing.", "label": "NotContribution"}
{"text": "Another useful taxonomy is proposed by Kulesza et al. by consid- ering two dimensions of explanation idelity: soundness (how truthful each element in an explanation is with respect to the underlying system) and completeness (the extent to which an explanation describes all of the underlying system)", "label": "NotContribution"}
{"text": "While we did not ind statistical signiicance of the three-way interaction that validates the efectiveness of sensitivity-based explanation, a possibility is that there are individual diferences for which the model did not account.", "label": "NotContribution"}
{"text": "A significant topic of research has been interfaces that can collect, explicitly or implicitly, the personal goals and interests of users as they search for information and modify their viewing of content correspondingly.", "label": "NotContribution"}
