the number of items to learn per teacher was 200 (instead of 500), to avoid very long evaluation sessions, and", "(ii) the space between two sessions managed by the same teacher was only approximately (rather than strictly) equal to one day, on account of the alternation between the two teachers.", "11", "the CS teacher significantly outperforms it (  = 8294 . 5,  < 0 . 001,   < 0 . 001,  = 100  2).", "For both model-based teachers, the error of prediction diminishes over time as expected.", "With human learners (see Figure 4), the number of items learned proved to be significantly greater with the myopic teacher than with the Leitner teacher (  = 174 . 5,  = 0 . 019,   = 0 . 038,  = 24  2).", "In contrast against the corresponding results obtained with artificial learners, no significant difference was visible between the CS and the Leitner teacher (  = 434 . 5,  = 0 . 828,   = 1 . 655,  = 29  2).", "In a parallel with the artificial agents in the item-specific condition with a non-omniscient psychologist, the ratio of items learned to items seen for the myopic teacher was below the baseline figure (  = 435,  = 0 . 003,   = 0 . 005,  = 24  2), while no significant difference emerged for the CS teacher (  = 397,  = 0 . 721,   = 1 . 441,  = 29  2).", "Comparisons.", "We compared both", "(i) the number of items learned (since probabilities of recall were not directly accessible, an item was considered learned if it was successfully recalled twice during the evaluation session) and", "(ii) the ratio between of items learned to all items seen between a Leitner teacher and the model-based teacher (a myopic or CS teacher, depending on the subject).", "The statistical procedure was identical to the one employed for the corresponding comparison with artificial agents.", "To verify that the teacher actually adapted at the level of users and items, we present the final parameter estimates made by the psychologist in Figure 5.", "Human (performance)", "In our simulations with a learner that, by construction, has exact correspondence with the model, the long-termplanning teacher did better than the Leitner and myopic teachers  markedly and consistently.", "We were surprised to find, however, that with human learners the myopic teacher, which greedily picks the best next item to show, fared better than did the longer-term planning approach.", "From our current knowledge, we attribute this finding to the predictive model in our framework, because the results with artificial learners were conclusive while the ones for humans were not.", "Moreover, any errors in inference are bound to be compounded in planning, and this could explain why the myopic planner maintained its performance.", "These observations highlight the importance of developing more robust planning methods in future work.", "Our work extends research on model-based approaches for tutoring systems by offering a modular framework to combine online inference specific to each user and each item with online planning that takes the learners time constraints into account.", "As presented above, an implementation of this framework with a simple memory model showed favorable results; hence, it warrants further research.", "Our experiments, with both artificial and human learners, attest that even a simple model can offer performances at least equalling that of the industry-standard Leitner method, as evaluated by two metrics:   learned, which captures (raw) performance, and the   learned /  seen ratio, which can be interpreted as the precision of the teacher.", "Furthermore, we observed that our method successfully adapts to the variability of learners learning capabilities and items difficulty level.", "The main contribution represented by this paper has less to do with the performance of an end-to-end method than it does with proposing a modular framework that, in contrast to prior methods, clearly advances our tackling of multiple aspects of learning.", "For instance, it may be possible to include elements such as additional cognitive aspects of memorization, among them subtler ones (such as the shape of the forgetting curve [9, 21] and modeling the spacing effect separately [5, 24]).", "Among other factors for possible consideration are the influence of words similarity and/or of", "context on memorization (e.g. how learning   : eight interferes with learning   : people), non-binary responses, and irregular learning sessions (for which one might employ a predictive model of the learners favorite moments in the course of the day, with the teachers expected rewards getting weighted accordingly).", "Also, extensions are possible for addressing the nature or type of various teaching objectives: focusing on particular classes of words, paying attention to exam dates, attention to quality over quantity, etc.", "Advances in all of these directions can be easily integrated into our framework, and attention to all the various aspects listed is necessary for enhancing the learning experience of real human users.", "Finally, we would expect this framework to hold great potential for extension to other application contexts wherein adaptation to the user and other individualization would be beneficial.", "We thank all study participants for their time, and our colleagues and the reviewers for their helpful comments.", "This work was funded by Aalto Universitys Department of Communications and Networking (Comnet), the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI), the
