communication between romantic couples.", "Given the intimate nature of physiological data [26], people feel most comfortable sharing them with close others [41], who may also be the most interested and equipped to understand them as limited contextual cues.", "For instance, couples can interpret work breaks or distance from home based how many steps their partner has made [14].", "In lightweight communication, defined by quick exchanges [8] through minimal interaction or content generation, even minimal messages between close partners can convey meaning like thinking of you [7, 28].", "Thus, we target the closest partners: significant others.", "In the present work, we expand on expressive biosignals literature by demonstrating the effects of shifting from communication without biosignals to communication with biosignals.", "We designed, developed, and deployed Significant Otter, an Apple Watch and iPhone app that enables romantic couples to send heart rate-driven otter animations as messages to each other.", "By setting adaptive thresholds for each person based on their past heart rate and motion data, Significant Otter intelligently suggests animations that match their current emotional and physical state.", "To explore the design of expressive biosignals as AI-mediated communication, we incorporate AI-recommended sets of shareable sensed states.", "In a one-month within-subjects field study, we investigate how couples behaviors and perceptions are affected when shifting from a sensing OFF version of the app, with no biosignals sensed, to a sensing ON version, with biosignals sensed.", "We present qualitative results from interviews during the study and discuss opportunities and challenges for biosignals in communication.", "Today, we rely heavily on digital technology to connect with others.", "Furthermore, with the global COVID-19 pandemic diminishing in-person social contact, technology-mediated communication is more prominent than ever before [35].", "However, digital communication is well-known to be challenging due to limited access to important nonverbal cues, such as our body movements and facial expressions [32, 60, 63].", "The core contributions of this work are: (1) Significant Otter 2 , a novel smartwatch and phone app that promotes communication and connection between romantic partners through animated avatars recommended based on heart rate; (2) an empirical study with 20 couples who used Significant Otter with sensing OFF and ON that demonstrates the value of biosignals as a lightweight and authentic social cue; (3) design implications and future directions for expressive biosignals research, including suggestions for integration into social platforms as a form of AI-mediated communication.", "With the integration of biosignals, Significant Otter similarly incorporates physicalness, expressivity, and awareness to support intimate communication.", "Significant Otter can simulate physicalness through shared heart rate representing the bodys physical state.", "It can support expressivity by providing an emotional language for couples through otter animations embedded with heart rate, which communication partners can use to create emotional meaning together [41].", "Finally, the apps heart rate animations can enable awareness by providing contextual cues that display presence, activities, and mood [17, 42].", "We describe the full Significant Otter system in Section 3.", "An emerging area of research in HCI has explored a novel social cue for improving the way we interact over technology: our biosignals.", "Biosignals, such as heart rate and skin conductance, are well known to change according to our physical and emotional responses, and can be revealed in everyday interactions using wearable sensor technologies.", "For example, applications like Pulsoid or Onbeat 1 explore this possibility through livestreams of heart rate during gameplay or exercise.", "Researchers have shown that expressive biosignals , or biosignals displayed as a social cue, have the potential to facilitate communication as a means to recognize and express our emotions and physical being [21, 23, 26, 4043, 50, 55, 57].", "However, researchers have not yet described the role that biosignals play in communication.", "Biosignals are personal and private data that require careful design and consideration [20, 22, 26, 41].", "In particular, as cues that are sensed and recommended by systems, they present a new form of AI-mediated communication that could shape our interactions in unintended ways [25].", "Thus, it is crucial that we understand the value and consequences of integrating them into our existing means of communicating.", "Hancock and colleagues define AI-mediated communication as mediated communication between people in which a computational agent operates on behalf of a communicator by modifying, augmenting, or generating messages to accomplish communication or interpersonal goals.", "They suggest that AI-mediated communication systems may have important effects on interpersonal dynamics, including self-presentation and disclosure, and subsequently, meaningful and intimate relationships [25].", "As a relatively new area of research, much of the AI-mediated communication work has focused on text, such as AI-recommended wording in emails [4] and AI-generated profiles on sites like AirBnB [25].", "The present work expands on this research by exploring AI-mediated communication through expressive biosignals.", "A breadth of HCI research has explored technologies that can support significant others, including those that integrate biosignals.", "In their review on technology-mediated intimacy, Hassenzahl and colleagues described different strategies for supporting important aspects of intimacy [16].", "For example, physicalness represents the physical aspect of intimacy, and has been simulated through mediated touch [15] and gestures [12, 52], as well as feeling someone elses heartbeat [64].", "Expressivity describes expressing feelings through a language unique to the couple, such as mutual affection through on-off signals [29] or couple-specific symbols [36].", "Awareness of ones partner has been explored in systems that display a partners presence, activities, and mood through availability [6, 10] or sensed contextual information like location [2, 66], motion [3, 67], and heart rate [17], or a combination of these data [14].", "Expressive biosignal systems recommend a users current state as part of interpersonal communication.", "The recommendation can be used to augment communication, such as by providing emotional context for text messages [17, 41] and joint activities in mixed reality [55], or to generate new messages in communication, such as emoji-like animations [42].", "Like other forms of AI-mediated communication, AI-recommended states through biosignals could impact key aspects of communication.", "For example, in their deployment of Ripple, a shirt that displayed a wearers skin conductance, Howell and colleagues found that people granted the system high degrees of authority over their feelings and, therefore, the feelings they conveyed to others [22].", "On the other hand, Liu and colleagues showed that some people may strongly disagree with an AI-recommended state, and subsequently fail to use the system to communicate meaningfully with others [42].", "To address these issues, we explore the design of an expressive biosignal system with a lower level of autonomy , i.e., the degree of control it has over messages [25].", "Specifically, we explore communication in which people choose between shareable states suggested by the AI, rather than the AI providing only one possible state.", "To understand the effects of biosignals-based recommendations, we compare peoples perceptions of their communication when they can share from a set of random versus sensed states, described in more detail in Section 3.", "Existing literature on expressive biosignals have primarily explored their potential for supporting how we communicate and connect with each other.", "Following the interaction model of communication [65], these works suggest that biosignals can support the key stages of communication: sending a message, receiving and understanding that message, and responding to it with feedback.", "By sharing their biosignals as a message, a sender can express both emotions and daily activities, such as texting ones heart rate to convey feeling down or taking a walk [41].", "Upon viewing the senders biosignals, a receiver can become aware of the senders state.", "Hassib and colleagues showed that when accessing someones heart rate on a mobile messaging app, people can recognize when that person is angry or on their way home [17].", "A recent controlled study also showed that biosignals increase emotional perspectivetaking, or imagining someone elses emotions, in the context of a narrative story [43].", "Receivers may subsequently respond with feedback based on their understanding of the senders emotions.", "In prior studies where people shared their biosignals in conversation or sporadically during the day, receivers often acknowledged, provided support for, or discussed the meaning of the senders biosignals [21, 22, 42].", "Expressive biosignals may also impact social connection, or a persons subjective sense of having close and positively experienced relationships with others in the social world [56].", "According to Slovk and colleagues, expressive biosignals may promote connectedness between people in two ways.", "First, they suggest that expressive biosignals are a form of emotional self-disclosure, as they can represent our internal emotional reactions during personal experiences [57].", "Self-disclosure is crucial for people to connect with each other, where it can improve the quality of interactions", "and closeness in relationships [1, 39].", "Second, Slovk and colleagues suggest that biosignals indicate a persons physical being as a representation of the daily physiological workings of our heart and other organs, thereby creating feelings of presence [57], which can lead to feelings of connectedness [24].", "For instance, Howell and colleagues showed that listening to someones heartbeat on a bench can elicit a sense of being alive and connected to another living person [23].", "Moreover, Liu and colleagues suggest that remote interactants can feel present with each other when sharing their biosignals over smartwatches [42].", "We designed Significant Otter based on prior expressive biosignals systems tested in everyday contexts [41, 42].", "Like these works, we focus on heart rate due to its wide availability on consumergrade wearables compared to other biosignals, representing the data as an animated avatar.", "However, unlike prior systems, Significant Otter recommends a set of heart rate-driven avatars, rather than a single number or avatar, in order to further explore biosignals in AI-mediated communication.", "We detail our system in the following section.", "Although these prior works suggest the potential for biosignals to support communication and connection, they have not illustrated the value of expressive biosignals.", "In particular, their emotionally expressive ability may already be achieved verbally and nonverbally through emojis and stickers [44, 59].", "Since expressive biosignals can elicit concerns around privacy [41, 57], cognitive load [40], and accuracy [22, 42, 47], it is crucial that we understand the value they add to existing modes of expression.", "Research suggests several possibilities for expressive biosignals to improve how we interact today, drawing from their potential to validate feelings as objective cues [22, 41, 55].", "In the different stages of communication, biosignals sent as a message could be a more vivid way to express ourselves emotionally, understand those expressions directly from the body, and subsequently provide improved feedback.", "As vivid emotional expressions from our bodies, they may be perceived as more authentic and intimate disclosures of our internal experiences, leading to greater feelings of connection.", "We explore these possibilities by comparing communication with and without biosignals.", "Significant Otter is an Apple Watch and iPhone app that enables two people to send animated otter characters to each other based on their biosignals.", "Each person has an animated otter that reflects", "To our knowledge, only a few studies have compared the presence and absence of biosignals in social contexts [9, 26, 43, 46].", "However, these works did not test in real-world dyadic communication, instead focusing on perceptions of a target other in controlled laboratory settings.", "We address this gap through a field study with couples who used two versions of Significant Otter, an expressive biosignals app.", "Specifically, we investigate communication and social connection between couples who shift from a sensing OFF version, with no biosignals, to sensing ON, with biosignals.", "ON affect social connection between couples?", "RQ1: How does shifting from sensing OFF to sensing ON affect the stages of communication (sending, understanding, responding) between couples?", "RQ2: How does shifting from sensing OFF to sensing", "There are four types of state animations: emotions, activities, greetings, and affection.", "We chose emotion and activity animations according to expressions through biosignals shown in prior work [41].", "We included greeting and affection animations to represent minimal expressions of mutual affection [16], which prior work suggests are common use cases (hello, thinking of you) on similar apps [42].", "To limit the number of available states according to our pilot results, we included only a few greeting and affection states such that we could cover a sufficient number of sensed states (emotions and activities) to address our research questions.", "We ran two pilot studies as initial tests for Significant Otter.", "The first pilot tested peoples understanding of the sensing ON version, to ensure that people would recognize that their heart rate is sensed and tied to the animations.", "The pilot included seven couples (employees of a technology company and their significant others) who used the app freely for one week and were asked about their usage and perceptions of the app.", "Based on their responses, we iterated on the app to improve its usability.", "For instance, we determined the final list of animations based on the pilot results, which suggested that we should include states that people typically relate to heart rate (e.g., exercise), as well as limit the number of available animations for usability.", "The second pilot tested transitioning from sensing OFF to sensing ON.", "We ran this pilot for three weeks with three couples (employees of the same technology company and their significant others).", "The results confirmed that people viewed sensing ON as a feature update that included biosignals, and provided initial insights that informed the development of the study materials.", "We also ran this pilot during the early stages of the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders for many states in the United States.", "Stay-at-home orders required that people stay in their residences except for essential trips, such as for daily food and supplies or if they were essential workers (e.g., life-sustaining occupations, including employees in healthcare, food retail, and public transportation).", "The pilot informed ways to address possible COVID-19 circumstances that would affect the study.", "The final versions of the study app and study design are described in the following sections.", "To investigate our research questions, we created two study versions 3 of the Significant Otter app: sensing ON and sensing OFF, where biosignals are either sensed or not sensed, respectively.", "With sensing ON, people can send otter animations from a list of sensed states, suggested based on their biosignals.", "With sensing OFF, people can send otter animations from a list of random states, randomly selected by the system.", "For both versions, the app prompts people to name their otter and pair with the partner.", "Sensing ON requires people to accept HealthKit 4 and Motion & Fitness 5 permissions to access sensed heart rate and activity data from the watch.", "People can then view their otter on their watch or phone, and scroll through the list of animated states to send one to their partner.", "We developed Significant Otter as a watch-first app, since smartwatches can be an unobtrusive and lightweight platform for communicating biosignals [42], but we included a phone version due to Apples watch app requirements at the time.", "3.2.1 State animations.", "Significant Otter presents an interpreted representation for biosignals: animated avatars that correspond to different emotional and physical states.", "That is, the system determines an interpretation for a users heart rate by mapping it to multiple possible states, as opposed to presenting raw biosignals data (e.g., a heart rate number) [17].", "We made this decision based on prior work [41], which shows that raw data is less engaging and requires additional contextual clarification that may not be feasible on a lightweight smartwatch communication app.", "People can send two types of animations to their partner: states and reacts .", "People can send states to initiate communication, and use reacts to respond to their partners states.", "The study versions of the app contain a subset of the animations available in the public version, in order to focus on states that could be interpreted from biosignals.", "their inner state, which they can send to their partner.", "We designed Significant Otter to provide a playful way for couples to communicate.", "The app has been publicly available since November 2019, and over 59 thousand people have installed it as of January 2021.", "These include excited, angry, calm, sad, surprised, bored, and neutral otter animations.", "We chose these states to represent each quadrant of the valence-arousal model of emotion [53].", "The sensing ON version senses these states using heart rate data extracted from HealthKit.", "Since valence cannot be determined from the heart rate data, the system suggests states according to arousal levels determined from the data [11].", "For instance, excited and angry states are available when people are in high arousal, while the calm and sad states are available when they are in low arousal.", "Significant Otter determines different ranges of heart rate based on peoples historical data, including their min, max, walking, and resting heart rates from HealthKit, which Apple updates daily.", "The ranges are shown in Figure 2, and were determined through empirical testing within the research team.", "3.2.2 React animations.", "We included 14 different reacts to cover a variety of responses people could have to their partners state.", "Significant Otter initially had 22 react animations, which were designed based on social support literature and existing react systems [61].", "For the former, we focused on emotional support, or expressing caring and concern, as other types of support typically require more information [5, 27, 45], which would not be suitable for a lightweight platform.", "Reacts are not sensed in order to explore peoples decisions around responding to their partners states.", "Activities.", "These animations represent daily activities, including eating, sleeping, walking, running, and exercising.", "Eating and sleeping are time-based activities, inferred from heart rate changes during specific times.", "Eating is detected based on common meal times in the US (11AM-2PM and 5PM-8PM) [38] and neutral or high arousal [54], while sleeping is detected based on common bedtimes and hours slept in the US (10PM-8AM) [33] and low or neutral arousal [37].", "Walking and running are motion-based activities, classified by Apples Core Motion 6 .", "Exercising is detected solely from heart rate changes, and is presented during high or very high arousal.", "Based on feedback from the first pilot study, we reduced the number of reacts to increase usability.", "We ran a survey on Mechanical Turk to understand how people perceive the react animations in order to select the most relevant ones.", "45 participants interpreted characteristics of each react (e.g., extent of emotional support it provides), gave an example text message that would prompt them to use it as a response, and wrote the response that they believed it conveyed in words (see supplemental materials).", "We selected the final set of reacts to cover diverse possible responses to the Significant Otter states.", "This included emotions (similar to states), acknowledging the senders state or receipt of their state (e.g., I agree or OK), showing caring and affection for the sender (e.g., Im here for you or I love you), and indicating a desire for followup on a different platform (e.g., Call me ASAP).", "We removed reacts that elicited interpretations that did not suit the available states or were overly ambiguous.", "People can share their otter state through the main screen of Significant Otter on their watch or phone.", "People can enter the main screen through notification prompts to view their otter (explained in section 3.5 below), or by opening the app on their own.",

animations such that one can always convey either hi or thinking of you to their partner.", "Affection.", "This category shows animations where the couples two otters are interacting, including hugging and holding hands.", "These are not sensed, as people may want to show affection at any moment.", "Instead, these animations randomly rotate with greetings, as described above.", "watch, people can open the app through the app complication 7 on their watch face, which will show an otter icon, similar to an emoji, of one of their currently available states.", "The icons are designed to act as short-form representations for the larger animations, such that people can glance to see their state otter without opening the app.", "After opening the app, people can simply tap on their otter to send it to their partner, and their partner can view the otters animated state on their own device (see Figure 1).", "People can scroll to view and send other possible states, using the Apple Watch crown or swiping up/down on the phone.", "We show multiple shareable states due to limitations in detecting emotions from signals available on the watch (e.g., low granularity of heart rate, determining valence), as well as recommendations from prior work [42] to explore systems that collaborate with the user to determine their state.", "By providing a limited set of other possible states, people can reflect on their subjective emotions alongside the apps suggestions, and then select one of the recommended states.", "Therefore, the system has low autonomy [25], where the states that people send are partially automated and partially determined by the user.", "At least one affection or greeting state is always included in the sensed state list, as described above.", "With sensing OFF, the list is restricted to two to five random states to match the possible sizes of the sensed state list.", "The states are randomized every 10 minutes to match the frequency of sensing states with sensing ON.", "When people receive their partners otter, they have the option to react within the app.", "After they view their partners state animation, the app will enter the react mode, where they can scroll through all 14 possible reacts (using the watch crown or swiping up/down on the phone) and tap on one to send it as a response to their partner.", "We include all possible reacts in order to understand peoples preferences and decisions in reacting with certain animations.", "People can also react through quick reacts, selecting from one of four possible reacts shown in the notification they receive to respond without opening the app.", "Quick reacts are only featured on the", "watch and are primarily included for usability, as a lightweight way to respond without viewing the full animation.", "The four available quick reacts are fixed and selected based on the most frequently used reacts in the public version of the app (love, nodding, handholding, and hugging).", "Finally, people can choose not to react by selecting Dont react in the app after viewing the animation, or dismissing the notification.", "Reacts are the same between both study versions

notified periodically during the day (at least 45 minutes apart, to minimize invasiveness) with a Message from your otter notification (see Figure 6(b)).", "Opening the notification shows an icon of an available state animation.", "We include these notifications to encourage people to share their current state with their partner.", "Notifications are time-based and thus appear regardless of whether the users state changed.", "This is due to limitations of the Apple Watch, which does not enable real-time heart rate sensing (outside of a fitness tracking session) necessary for recording in-the-moment state changes.", "This also helped to control differences in the notifications between the two versions of the app, as the app with sensing OFF cannot record state changes.", "Tapping on

an average of 1.54 states and 0.54 reacts with sensing ON (week 4).", "There was a slight non-significant drop in usage from sensing OFF to sensing ON, which participants attributed to COVID-19-related changes to their life circumstances (e.g., changes in their work schedule or ability to meet their partner).", "Despite using the sensing ON version less, 30 out of 40 participants

they wanted to their partner.", "We describe these opportunities and challenges for integrating biosignals into communication in more detail below.", "Our results suggest that biosignals helped reduce this ambiguity, where participants no longer assigned different meanings to the animations.", "Instead, the animations became meaningful on their own, where participants understood them as simply representative of their own or their partners current state.", "This facilitated sending state animations, because participants no longer had to think about what they could mean and, like in prior work [41], sent them primarily to share their current state.", "This also facilitated understanding and responding to those animations, because they could appropriately react when they understood what they meant, such as by agreeing, reciprocating, or showing concern for their partners state.", "Seeing their own sensed state also encouraged them to reflect on how they were feeling, and be more honest with both themselves and their partner by sharing it with them.", "Participants similarly felt that their partner was conveying their honest state with them.", "Some couples noted that even if they are fairly open with each other, they appreciated knowing that their partners state was backed by data and that their partner was not just putting up a front.", "Less ambiguity.", "Sharing a sensed otter was also less ambiguous than sharing a randomized otter.", "With sensing OFF, participants assigned various meanings to the otter animations, including those that they were not originally designed for, such as suggestions and needs.", "Participants would even send animations with no intended meaning, just to send one to their partner.", "This flexibility in the otter animations aligns with the flexibility of emojis, where an emoji can be used to convey numerous possible messages [49, 68], and are thus known to be expressive yet ambiguous even when used in textual contexts [48].",

states, expecting a wider and more expressive variety, while others appreciated that they did not need to look through hundreds of options for a specific one.", "After updating to sensing ON, participants perceived that the state list was personalized to them, where the sensed states were more accurate to how they were feeling or what they were doing than the randomized states.", "Thus, their otter became more representative of them and was easier to send to their partner.", "The smartwatch prompted participants with notifications that became personalized suggestions about how they were feeling with sensing ON, rather than dismissable nudges to use the app with sensing OFF.", "When participants viewed the notifications without opening the app, participants simply made yes or no decisions to share their otter rather than scrolling through emoji-like options or even thinking to send their otter on their own.", "Because it knows exactly how youre feeling versus like me having to look through it and kinda of tick something.

[13].", "By integrating biosignals into existing platforms, people could benefit from centralized communication with their partners while expressing themselves in more authentic ways through the sensed states.", "In platforms such as texting and mobile messaging, they could also could easily start new conversations about the states they share, a common pattern we observed in our study.", "Overall, participants viewed both versions of Significant Otter as a lightweight communication channel that enabled them to easily to keep in touch with their partner and let each other know how they are doing.", "In their baseline usage of the app with sensing OFF, participants felt the otter animations were an easy way to communicate without words, using them to convey their current state and suggest activities.", "However, this communication was also limited because a simple animation could mean multiple things or required more detail.", "For most participants, Significant Otter with sensing ON mitigated some of the issues with sensing OFF and enhanced participants ability to connect with each other.", "Our results show that", "As part of existing platforms, biosignals would primarily function as a means to augment communication as opposed to acting as standalone messages like in Significant Otter.", "Rather than relying on relationship context, people would reference the augmented communication content to interpret the biosignals (e.g., text in mobile messaging [18, 41]).", "Researchers and designers of communication platforms could explore how biosignals could augment various types of communication content, such as images, videos, or emojis, and new interaction patterns that may emerge.", "For example, biosignals could become new types of emojis or integrate with existing emojis by suggesting specific emojis or limiting the available options.", "This could help people navigate the ever growing list of emojis, as well as clarify potentially ambiguous emojis.", "Suggested emojis could be annotated in order to designate them as sensed states (e.g., a heart symbol, beats per minute, or special effect or badge attached to the image).", "Though the reduced effort made keeping in touch easier, effort is an important quality of communication that contributes to meaningful connection and close relationships [30, 31].", "Moreover, work on AI-mediated communication suggests that systems that generate messages for communication, such as Significant Otters sensed state animations, can affect perceptions of authenticity [51] and trustworthiness [25] in the sender of the message.", "Thus, despite sensed states being inherently more personal and intimate, they could potentially prompt less personal ways of communicating if the system has more agency than the user.", "In the following section, we recommend future research directions and system designs to explore how to reconcile this tension.", "biosignals can facilitate each stage of communication ( RQ1 ), where sending, understanding, and responding to the state animations were easier with sensing ON than with sensing OFF, because the app curated more straightforward messages for them to send, distilled to participants sensed states as opposed to user-prescribed meanings.", "Biosignals also supported feelings of connection between romantic partners ( RQ2 ), where participants described feeling compelled to share honest emotions through the sensed state animations, rather than put up a front.", "Additionally, they felt the sensed otters were more representative of them and their partner, conveying a sense of their bodys physical responses.", "Taken together, our results describe the role of biosignals in dyadic communication, distinct from system features such as the smartwatch or animated avatars [42], as promoting easier and more authentic communication.", "However, despite these benefits, biosignals also introduced new concerns around accuracy and agency over the message, where some participants felt the system was overly suggestive on how they were feeling or what to communicate to their partner.", "This further illustrates the tensions in AI-recommended versus subjectively interpreted emotions found in prior work [19, 22], particularly due to variations in lay understanding or confidence around ones own emotions.", "6.2.2 Addressing user expectations for sensing.", "We found that varying perceptions of accuracy and agency over the animations affected participants ability to use the sensing ON version of the

seeing if it was the otter I wanted to send or anything like that.", "Oneparticipantwarnedagainstthis power ofsuggestion,where the system could influence them into thinking they felt a certain way.", "This aligns with prior work by Hollis and colleagues [19], which suggests that people may overly trust emotion sensing systems and be influenced by the systems interpretations of their emotions.", "as well as ongoing research on emotion detection, designers need to consider how to present and incorporate sensing technology both in its current and future levels of accuracy.", "That is, even if the system claims to be accurate based on the users physical state, the detected emotion may conflict with how the user subjectively believes they feel [42] or overly influence their feelings [19, 22].", "For Significant Otter, we lowered the autonomy of the system [25], where the app suggested both a single state in notifications and a list of possible states within the app.", "Some participants continued to be skeptical of the suggested states, having strong beliefs about how they are feeling, while others were confused by our design, believing that they should see only one recommendation.", "In fact, a few people did focus solely on the one recommendation in the notification, ignoring the list of in-app states.", "Future directions in this area should investigate new ways for expressive biosignals systems to collaborate with peoples subjective understanding of their own state.", "For example, researchers could explore systems that support different lay theories of emotions and how they affect perceptions of the systems accuracy, such as whether the user interprets emotions based on external contextual cues or internal physiological experiences [62, 69].", "Designers of these systems should clearly and carefully introduce how sensing in the system works.", "For example, onboarding steps could detail the systems approach to emotion (e.g., its relationship to the bodys physiological state, why the system might suggest multiple possible emotions), or provide adjustable settings that match ones personal understanding of their own state.", "Future work could also explore how to involve people in system recommendations, such that they can have more control over what they are feeling and how they share those feelings.", "For example, the system could allow people to provide feedback on their state in order to improve the system and feel involved in the systems suggestions, or prompt them to interpret the suggested state before sharing it with their partner.", "This could encourage people to engage in more effort and meaning-making with their partner, and enhance the authenticity of the AI-recommended message.", "Finally, researchers should consider how peoples understanding of their state and expectations for the system may be affected by different types of expressive biosignals.", "People may have a more developed understanding about their heart rate given its accessibility, including in fitness trackers and watches, or simply being able to feel when ones own heart beats faster.", "On the other hand, less accessible biosignals such as skin conductance or brain activity may be less understood or produce different lay interpretations (e.g., associating the brain with cognitive functions), which could potentially affect peoples willingness to accept the systems state recommendations.", "Finally, while we recruited a diverse sample of participants from different backgrounds, participants were self-selected and may have shown a greater interest in wearable and couple-specific technologies.", "Additionally, the shortest relationship length among participants was 11 months.", "People in earlier stages of their relationship or without established communication practices with each other may use the app in different ways.", "Given stay-at-home orders, we also restricted recruitment to people who were living apart from their partner or living together if one or both of them were essential workers.", "Thus, we were unable to capture how people that did not match these criteria might use the app outside of these unusual circumstances.", "It is also possible that our participants would engage with the app differently outside of these circumstances, as many had to adjust to changes in their daily routine during the study.", "in situ watches for use in their everyday lives, in order to achieve high ecological validity.", "Given the differences in participants lifestyles, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as tendencies towards different devices (e.g., participants with large hands experiencing difficulty interacting with the watch app interface), participants naturally had diverse experiences with the app.", "Additionally, the app had hard-coded times set for certain states, which may not have matched peoples typical patterns.", "Future systems should consider providing options for people to set their typical meal or sleeping times, or sense additional signals such as location to better predict their state.", "Limitations of the Apple Watch OS also affected whether the app worked as intended for all participants, where some participants received no notifications while others felt that they received too many.", "Thus, while our qualitative findings present a variety of interesting communication patterns that stem from participants diverse usage, studies with greater levels of control or larger sample sizes are necessary to clarify potential causal effects that biosignals have on communication.", "More granular data collection would also help to capture and further understand the differences in participants usage, such as the number of notifications that influenced sending a state or participants perceptions of each sent state.", "Though our findings elucidate the value of expressive biosignals in communication, there are several limitations to this work.", "First, we ran a non-counterbalanced within-subjects study in order to reduce confusion in participants mental model of the app, where
