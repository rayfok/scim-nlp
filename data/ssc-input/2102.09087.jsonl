upper bound earlier (with 1.5K samples per device) than the rest of the models.", "ExplorativeTap is a two-handed interaction method that exploits signals from both the front (touch) and back of the phone tap (see Figure 9b).", "Users can use the exploration finger on the screen to glide over the on-screen objects, hear them, and perform a back tap to confirm selection.", "This is an improvement for the visual impairment accessibility modes, such as Voice Over on iOS and Talk Back on Android.", "These accessibility modes occupy the common on-screen gestures (e.g. swipe and touch), and their users need to learn a more complicated system navigation gestures.", "In contrast, ExplorativeTap starts the accessibility mode by a double back tap, selects object by a single back tap, and exits by lifting the exploration finger.", "It, therefore, solves the conflicts with system navigation gestures, and thus can be helpful for users with low vision and print disability, who need quick and temporary access to the accessibility mode.", "Without adding new sensor hardware, TapNet enables many new input possibilities on smartphones.", "In addition to providing shortcuts to quick activations of apps or functions such as camera and screenshot, this section sketches out four applications enabled by TapNets capability of measuring multiple proprieties in addition to the presence of tap event, such as direction and location.", "Please refer to our supplemental video for these applications in action.", "the phone (based on the same IMU signal input to TapNet) to select gesture, and back tap to perform the selected gesture (e.g. back gesture, scrolling, app switch).", "In other words, AssistiveTap provides the back-of-device alternatives for the most commonly used on-screen gestures, by using the gesture combination of back tap and tilting.", "It can be beneficial in situations, where one-handed interaction is preferable or even required.", "Although evaluation results demonstrated that TapNet benefited from cross-device training, we do not expect the current TapNet trained on these two devices would directly apply to unseen devices without further training, i.e. a cross-device model.", "However, the joint training architecture has been shown effective and this is a promising step toward a device adaptive model.", "We have set up the infrastructure and we plan to further investigate along this line by adding new devices and also opensource our implementation.", "biomechanics, and thus further improves the performance until its next plateau.", "This performance gain is from knowing how much people can vary.", "To reach the ideal performance, it becomes a must to know the person-specific information, i.e. how exactly the target user acts.", "In practice, especially for learning-based gesture studies, it can be beneficial to identify the curve in Figure 8, and then decide the needed number of training participants for specific tasks.", "Inertial Touch estimates tap force from the IMU signals and tap location from the TapNet output.", "We can define Inertial Touch as a fast touch event with a strong tapping momentum .", "As TapNet estimates", "TapNet opens up new interaction opportunities such as onehanded interaction that uses off-screen tapping or designated tap gestures.", "TapNet is robust to phone case and fabric, and thus can be used for wearable interaction without specialized smart fabrics [7].", "This study also offers new potential for other research domains, including biometrics.", "For instance, it is possible to improve continuous and passive authentication [2, 35, 46] by using tap properties that contain biometric information, i.e. with a clear gap between the first two plateaus (orange area) in Figure 8.", "Off-screen tap recognition makes it possible to interact with objects living in different interface layers, such as background targets that do not react to on-screen touch.", "For instance, TapNet can enable users to interact with flashcards or news feeds shown in the wallpaper (see Figure 9c).", "They can back tap to change the flashcard or news feeds, or edge tap to switch a different set of them, and these can be done even on the lock screen.", "It enables the user to utilize the bits and pieces of time for their favorite spare time activity.", "AssistiveTap allows users to complete a number of system interactions using back tap and tilting.", "Users can perform a back double tap to invoke the AssistiveTap interface (see Figure 9a), then tilt", "The aforementioned use cases can be particularly useful in challenging situations when one-handed and non-contact interactions are preferable or required.", "For example, AssistiveTap exploits back tap and titling to partially address the issue of limited thumb reaching area during one-handed interaction.", "ExplorativeTap allows for the coordination between on-screen and off-screen interactions and thus saves the need for learning additional set of on-screen gestures.", "Inertial Touch offers auxiliary impact information beyond capacitive sensing.", "These are just a few application examples of tapping into TapNets ability to detect multiple tap properties.", "This paper presents the design, training, implementation and application of TapNet for off-screen mobile input.", "TapNet employs a multi-task convoluational neural network with motion signals as primary input and phone form factor as auxiliary information.", "It allows for joint learning on data across devices and simultaneous estimation of multiple tap properties.", "In comparison to many alternatives, this neural network architecture worked the best towards our goal of increasing the UI design space of off-screen interactions.", "To train and optimize this and other alternative ML models, we developed a one-person dataset for training and a multi-person dataset for testing.", "The evaluation results show that", "1) TapNet significantly outperformed the state of the art especially in difficult recognition tasks such as tap location estimation;", "2) multi-task learning is more data efficient, showing greater advantage particularly with a limited amount of training data;", "3) cross-device training with phone form factor increases the efficiency of data utilization; and", "4) one-channel CNN can achieve cross-channel signal alignment more efficiently than its multi-channel counterpart.", "We verified the hypothesis that training on the one-person data can still generalize well across users if the diversity of the training data can be ensured.", "This sheds light on the conceptual relation between model performance and ML training strategy in IMU-based input systems.", "We demonstrated that many new interaction use cases could be enabled by TapNet.", "Taken together, the TapNet project made significant progress towards practically enabling and enlarging the off-screen interaction design space by deep learning from on-device IMU signals, establishing new benchmarks with reproducible results, datasets and codebase.", "tap location from force and angle changes, it can function even when capacitive sensing fails (Figure 9d).", "Common use situations include when users are wearing gloves, having long fingernails, or when there are waterdrops on the touchscreen.", "REFERENCES"]}
