chatbots have been used to conduct interviews by engaging users in one-on-one text-based conversations [67].", "Recent studies show that interview chatbots are more effective at engaging users and eliciting quality information from the users, compared to traditional online surveys [31, 66, 67].", "To address the above two challenges, we have been developing a tool, called iChatProfile , which can aid chatbot designers in building, evaluating, and improving interview chatbots iteratively.", "In particular, iChatProfile automatically analyzes chat transcripts and computes a set of chatbot performance metrics to present designers with a chatbot profile (Fig 1", "Based on the chatbot profile, iChatProfile also automatically generates a set of design suggestions to guide designers to improve the chatbot (Fig 1", "To achieve above goals, designers often conduct pilot studies prior to a formal study [49].", "However, interview chatbot designers face two challenges in detecting let alone fixing the potential issues revealed by the pilot studies.", "First, designers must examine chat transcripts to discover potential issues and it is laborious and time consuming to do so manually.", "For example, Fig 2", "(a) shows that an interview question poses a challenge for a user due to a lack of clarity, while Fig 2", "(b) shows a chatbot-unrecognized user input during an interview, which could result in poor user experience or even abandoned interviews.", "To detect such issues in practice, chatbot designers must examine chat transcripts (Fig 2", "(c)) to discover them.", "It is laborious and time consuming to do so manually especially if the designers need to detect such issues from a large number of chat transcripts.", "Second, even if the designers have discovered such issues from reading chat transcripts, they might not know how to fix the issues and improve the chatbot due to a lack of relevant experience (e.g., designing effective interview interactions).", "Despite their promises, it is challenging and time consuming to build effective interview chatbots due to the limitations in todays technologies and the complexity involved in interview conversations [18, 65].", "Like building any complex interactive systems [42], one potential approach is to design and improve an interview chatbot iteratively.", "Specifically, the iterative design of an interview chatbot is to fulfill two main goals.", "First, like designing any user interviews or surveys [7, 42], designers of an interview chatbot need to ensure the effective design of an interview task (e.g., proper and clear wording of questions).", "Second, like building any conversational agents [29], designers of an interview chatbot need to make sure that the chatbot can successfully carry out such an interview task [65].", "In this paper, we present the key steps taken to build iChatProfile .", "First, we present a formative study that was conducted to understand the difficulties that designers face when building an interview chatbot and identify their desired design assistance.", "Second, we describe a computational framework that quantitatively measures the effectiveness of an interview chatbot from multiple dimensions, including elicitation ability, user experience, and ethics.", "Third, we present iChatProfile that was built based on our formative study and the computational framework.", "To validate the effectiveness of iChatProfile , we designed and conducted a between-subject user study that compared the performance of chatbots designed with or without using iChatProfile .", "A total of 10 chatbots were created and evaluated live by 1349 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk.", "We compared the performance of these chatbots.", "The results show that the chatbots designed with the help of iChatProfile performed significantly better along many dimensions, including improved user response quality and user experience.", "Researchers have developed various chatbots to elicit information from users through text-based conversations.", "For example, Bohus and Rudnicky introduce dialog systems that gather required", "AI-powered conversational user interfaces, also known as AI chatbots or chatbots for short, allow users to communicate with computers in natural language, providing more flexible [5] and personalized user experience [69].", "Such benefits have encouraged the creation of a wide array of chatbot applications, such as virtual assistants [38], social companions [56], and interview chatbots [37].", "Our work is most relevant to the use of chatbots for information elicitation [31, 66, 67].", "To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first on building an assistive design tool for creating interview chatbots.", "As a result, our work reported here provides three unique contributions:", "ACM Reference Format:", "Our work is directly related to the efforts of creating interview chatbots.", "However, existing work focuses on developing interview chatbots for specific information elicitation tasks (e.g., [64, 66, 67]) or powering interview chatbots with specific skills (e.g., giving them a personality [71] and active listening skills [65]).", "While we learn from these efforts, our work reported here has a very different focus: we want to build a tool that can automatically evaluate the performance of an interview chatbot and provide design suggestions for improving the chatbot.", "information for performing specific tasks (e.g., making travel reservations) [4].", "More recently, a number of interview chatbots have been developed to elicit information from a target audience.", "For example, a chatbot is built to interview students for effective teaming [66] and another chatbot to interview gamers for eliciting their game opinions [67].", "Williams et al. have developed a chatbot to interview employees for workplace productivity [64].", "Compared to traditional, static online surveys, these interview chatbots enhance information elicitation [31, 66] by providing interactive feedback [8] and asking follow-up questions [46].", "Our work on generating design suggestions is also related to various efforts on guiding the design of human-computer interfaces, such as chatbot systems [21] and graphical user interfaces (GUI) [36, 68].", "For example, Han et al. combine domain-specific knowledge together with observational studies to generate rule-based design suggestions for task-oriented chatbots [21].", "One of the drawbacks of this approach lies in its inflexibility of adapting design suggestions to changing design goals or dynamic design issues occurring in real time.", "On the other hand, Lee et al. use autoencoder and k-nearest neighbor algorithms to recommend GUI design examples that help designers in real time [36].", "Moreover, Xu et al. have developed a system that incorporates crowdsourcing to generate design suggestions for GUI designers [68].", "While we learn from these approaches, we are unaware of any approach to automatic generation of design suggestions based on computed chatbot performance as our approach does.", "There are a number of chatbot platforms and these platforms can be broadly divided into three categories.", "First, chatbot platforms like Chatfuel [60] and ManyChat [2] allow non-IT professionals to build a chatbot without coding.", "Since these platforms provide limited AI/NLP capabilities, it would be difficult to create interview chatbots that can understand users especially when open-ended interview questions are involved.", "The second type includes platforms like Google Dialogflow [13] and IBM Watson [25].", "These platforms provide designers with more flexibility to customize a chatbots AI/NLP capabilities but designers must have basic AI/NLP knowledge to use the tools.", "The third category includes platforms like Juji, which provides a rich set of pre-built AI capabilities to enable non-IT designers to build chatbots without any expertise of AI/NLP [59].", "While chatbot designers can choose to use any of the chatbot platforms, none of the platforms provides a tool like ours reported here: a tool that helps designers evaluate a chatbots performance and provides design suggestions to improve the chatbot.", "Researchers have developed a number of approaches to evaluating conversational AI systems.", "These approaches can be roughly organized into two categories: measuring objective system performance (e.g., task completion rate for task-oriented chatbots [29]) and assessing subjective human experience (e.g., measuring users trust in a chatbot [71]).", "Incorporating multiple metrics, evaluation frameworks have also been proposed to systematically measure the performance of conversational AI systems.", "For example, PARADISE has been used to evaluate the performance of task-oriented, spoken dialog systems [62], typically developed by AI/NLP experts.", "Unlike these works that evaluate conversational AI systems in general, our work presented here focuses on evaluating the performance of interview chatbots, typically designed by non-IT professionals.", "While we borrow some of the existing objective and subjective metrics, we have developed a computational framework specifically for quantifying the performance of interview chatbots with actionable insights design suggestions that can help designers improve an interview chatbot.", "We selected this set of interview questions for three reasons.", "First, we wanted to ensure the practical value of our tool development", "For non-IT chatbot designers, Juji relieves them from implementing many needed AI skills of interview chatbots while providing them with much freedom to customize a conversational experience.", "Specifically, Juji offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for chatbot designers to create, deploy, and manage their custom chatbots without coding [59].", "Below are some of the common chatbot customizations supported by Juji GUI.", "university, we recruited five students (3 males and 2 females, age ranges from 18 to 31) who were interested in building chatbots.", "None of them reported any prior chatbot design experience.", "Three of them interacted with conversational agents like Siri or Amazon Alexa.", "Our study was a semi-structured, face-to-face online interview.", "Each interview lasted about an hour and each participant received $20 for their time.", "At the beginning of each interview, the participants were asked about their past chatbot design experience.", "The participants were then given a 15-minute tutorial of Juji.", "They were also encouraged to try different Juji features and get themselves familiar with the Juji GUI.", "After the tutorial, the participants were asked to use Juji to design an interview chatbot that elicits user input about the COVID-19 pandemic.", "They were given a list of questions on this topic (Table 1).", "First, recent studies show that other researchers have used Juji to build various interview chatbots, which matches our focus on aiding the design of effective interview chatbots [37, 61, 65, 66].", "Building and deploying an interview chatbot on Juji is very similar to creating a survey on a popular survey platform like SurveyMonkey or Qualtrics.", "Designers use Jujis GUI to enter a set of interview questions and Juji will automatically generate a publicly accessible interview chatbot with a set of default conversational skills [67].", "Juji also automatically handles side talking and keeps a conversation on track to ensure the completion of an interview [65].", "Lastly, the extensibility of Juji makes it easy for us to build and integrate iChatProfile .", "Specifically, Juji provides APIs for developers to access chatbot services and extend Juji chatbots with third-party functions [27].", "Moreover, Juji is publicly available and provides an easy access for our study participants and also for others who wish to replicate or extend our work.", "Access interviewee responses .", "To help designers monitor interview progress and make design adjustments, Juji provides designers with an interactive report dashboard that displays interviewee responses visually Fig 3(c).", "These responses are automatically extracted from the interview conversations.", "Designers can also download all interviewee responses into a CSV file that contains all the question-response pairs collected.", "Because non-IT designers can use Juji to create working interview chatbots, Juji platform is suitable for testing whether our approach can assist any chatbot designers to improve their chatbot iteratively.", "Customize chatbot questions/messages .", "Not only can designers easily add/edit/delete text-based chatbot questions, but can also customize questions or messages by adding paraphrasing, inserting URLs or images, and using functions in such text (Fig 3(a)).", "For example, one can insert a function to retrieve an interviewees name to personalize a conversation.", "As mentioned in Section 2.2, there are three types of chatbot platforms.", "Although we could build iChatProfile on top of any chatbot platform, we decided to build it on Juji for three main reasons.", "Customize chatbot responses and persona .", "Designers can customize chatbot responses to user input by either directly reusing Juji pre-built conversations [28] or defining their own if-then statements.", "For example, Fig 3(b) shows such a customization.", "It states that if interviewees responses contain positive sentiment, the chatbot would then acknowledge such input accordingly.", "Additionally, one can customize chatbot persona or the pace of a conversation.", "To guide the development of iChatProfile , we conducted a study to first identify the types of design assistance desired by chatbot designers.Fromapublic", "In this study, we intentionally did not set any specific design requirements because we wished to observe what the participants would do and the challenges they would face.", "Each participant was allotted 30 minutes to design their interview chatbot.", "The allotted time was determined based on the results of a pilot study where 3 participants could accomplish such a design task well within 30 minutes.", "After completing the task, participants were interviewed to discuss the types of design help they had hoped to receive during their design process.", "We transcribed the audio conversations from these discussions.", "During the participant interviews, all participants expressed the importance of receiving design assistance.", "Our analysis also revealed two main types of design assistance that the participants wanted.", "The first type (T1) is objective, quantitative feedback on their existing chatbot design that could help designers understand the chatbot deficiencies and point them to the right directions to improve their chatbot.", "Almost all participants expressed the need for receiving such feedback on their chatbot.", "For example, one participant mentioned that \"I hope to receive some feedback telling me the exact score my chatbot will get ... Just like those user ratings on the website of Alexa skills.\" .", "The second type (T2) is design suggestions for improving a chatbot.", "Almost all participants expressed that they still would not know what to do even if a quantitative evaluation was available.", "For example, one participant stated \"I am really new to this (interview chatbot design). I am afraid even I was told this part should be improved, I still dont know how. More specific design suggestions would be of great help.\"", "This indicates that designers also wish to receive concrete and actionable design suggestions that could guide them to improve a chatbot.", "effort, which is to help designers build interview chatbots for realworld uses (e.g., practical user research).", "Second, we wanted the interview questions to appeal to a wide audience who would be interacting and evaluating the designed chatbots.", "Third, COVID-19 is a pressing topic that satisfies both criteria.", "Since our formative study indicated that chatbot designers wish to obtain certain quantitative feedback on the performance of their existing chatbot (T1), we first formulated a computational framework that quantitatively measures the effectiveness of such an interview chatbot from multiple aspects.", "The framework aims at achieving two goals:", "1) providing quantified insights into the performance of an interview chatbot;", "2) using such insights to provide specific and practical design suggestions for improving the chatbot.", "the chatbot \"debugging\" process.", "For example, one participant stated \"When doing chatbot response customization, I thought a lot about the wording choice since we all know that everyones having a hard time during this pandemic. I hoped my chatbot can always be empathetic but I have to admit it might not be the case due to so many different real-world cases.\"", "In such a case, providing designers with the actual conversation fragments (evidence) might help them better grasp the conversation situations and improve their chatbot.", "In other words, augmenting design suggestions with real conversational examples would also be helpful.", "We followed qualitative analysis methods and the grounded theory [40, 68] to code the participant interview data.", "During the first pass, two coders individually reviewed and coded participants responses.", "They then met and discussed their respective codes to identify common themes and reconcile differences.", "Below we report the main findings, which influenced the design of our computational framework for evaluating the performance of interview chatbots as well as the development of iChatProfile .", "In addition to obtaining design guidance, the participants also expressed the need of viewing relevant conversation examples in", "Based on the previous work on assessing human interviews [3, 7, 15, 20, 24, 50], communication theories for conducting effective interviews [47, 67], and evaluating chatbot effectiveness [12, 19, 55,", "Based on the desired design assistance, we derived three design goals of iChatProfile so it can fulfill designers needs:", "We derived C1 as iChatProfile is intended to help chatbot designers especially those with no AI/NLP expertise to design, evaluate, and improve interview chatbots.", "As a result, our effort will help democratize the applications and adoption of conversational AI.", "The purpose of C2 is to enable iChatProfile to be used with a wide range of chatbot platforms beyond Juji and benefit more designers.", "Following the goals (G1-G3) and the criteria (C1-C2), we designed iChatProfile as discussed in section 6.", "In addition to the three goals directly determined from the findings of our formative study (G1 from T1, G2+G3 from T2), we derived another two criteria to guide the implementation of iChatProfile for practical purposes:", "To ensure both the coverage and practicality of chatbot evaluation, we used four criteria to choose our metrics.", "First, we selected only metrics that can be used to generate design suggestions and help designers improve an interview chatbot.", "Second, we chose metrics to measure both a chatbots abilities to complete an interview task effectively ( elicitation abilities ) and a users experience with the chatbot ( user experience ) because an ideal interview chatbot should be able to complete interview tasks while delivering a satisfactory user experience.", "Moreover, we included metrics to evaluate the ethics of an interview chatbot because such a chatbot might engage with a user in a conversation on private and sensitive topics [3, 67].", "Third, we chose metrics to measure the performance of an interview chatbot both locally (interview question level) and globally (interview level).", "For example, the metric informativeness measures the amount of information conveyed by user responses to each interview question, while the metric user sentiment measures a users overall interview experience with a chatbot.", "This is to ensure specific design suggestions can be generated to help designers improve a chatbot question by question (locally), while providing designers with an assessment of the overall interview experience (globally).", "Fourth, we chose only metrics that can be easily obtained/computed from available data (e.g., chat transcripts).", "This is to facilitate real-time, automatic assessment of chatbot performance and design suggestion generation.", "Table 2 summarizes all the metrics.", "represents the word count within the response.", "Currently, we use the Wikipedia Corpus [1] to estimate word frequency.", "The primary task of interview chatbots is to elicit high-quality responses from participants.", "Existing literature shows that the success of an interview is often determined by two aspects: the elicited response quality and level of user engagement [7, 15, 19, 43, 55, 65].", "We thus model an interview chatbots elicitation abilities from two sub-dimensions: response quality and user engagement.", "While response quality directly assesses the quality of user responses to an interview question, the level of user engagement quantifies how much a participant is engaged with a chatbot from multiple aspects (e.g., how long an engagement is).", "65, 70], we formulated a set of performance metrics to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of an interview chatbot from three main dimensions: elicitation ability, user experience, and ethics.", "Here min_surprisal and

the question (   ) and the number of users who responded to the question (   ):", "This metric (e.g., a low informativeness score) can signal designers that there are potential issues with an interview question.", "For example, a question might be too broad and follow-up questions are needed to elicit more informative responses.", "Engagement Duration .", "This metric indicates how long a participant is willing to engage with an interview question.", "Although engagement duration alone does not signal the quality of user responses [67], we hope to use it as an indicator of potential issues with an interview question.", "For example, if the engagement duration of a particular open-ended interview question is exceedingly short, it might signal that the question is too narrow and needs to be rephrased to encourage more open and longer engagement.", "Response Length .", "This metric computes the word count of a respondents free-text response to an interview question.", "We chose this metric because previous work indicates that engaged respondents are more willing to give long responses [67].", "Designers can use this metric to gauge their chatbot performance and to make corresponding design improvements (e.g., adding follow-up questions or changing a yes/no question to an open-ended question to elicit longer responses).", "number of participants as the numerator.", "This metric (e.g., a low completion rate) can be used to signal potential issues related to an interview question (e.g., too vague) or the chatbots inability to handle user responses to the question

has to repeat itself during an interview.", "We include this metric for two reasons.", "First, repetition affects the quality of a dialogue system, which in turn influences user experience [55].",

user attitude (users overall feelings towards the whole chatbot, such as perceived trust and satisfaction in our work).", "A path model can then be generated to reveal causal relationships between different layers to make chatbot profiling and design suggestions more explainable.", "In particular, such relationships could explicate how design qualities may influence users attitude more clearly,
