people liked/disliked about GestureMap , and asked for ideas for improvements and additional features.", "Seeing this and related work as a toolbox, researchers may now consider various options: For example, AGATE 2.0 [61] is a highly specialized tool to compute agreement, which assumes a given labeled dataset.", "GestureMap could be used to label data and export it for analysis in tools like this.", "7.2.1 Initial Use.", "Upon first use, most people immediately animated a few gestures, saying that this was the most natural and familiar way to view the data Since the map visualization was unfamiliar to them, some had initial difficulties to understand the distinction of single poses (points) and entire gestures (paths).", "These people found the animation particularly important: Seeing the 3D skeleton and the 2D path animated in sync highlighted that a gesture was a path on the map and thus helped them to get familiar with the map concept.", "Summarising their initial experience, one person said: Although, the learning curve [...] is steep, once you understand the core concepts, this tool offers a great overview of the entire behavior that is captured in the dataset.", "7.2.2 Statistical Plot Overlays.", "We asked the researchers to analyze the proposals for crouch and throw ball .", "Throughout the interview we noticed that all participants preferred the scatter plot over

specifically searched for individual gesture proposals as templates (strategy 2) and used those to initialize the algorithm.", "Some found similar poses encoded in different map regions and noted that

gestures in more detail that differed largely from the shapes seen so far.", "In a sense, they searched for outlier behavior based on the path shapes.", "These participants noted that the 2D gesture path visualization offers a quick way to spot irregular behavior and that their analysis becomes an active search versus passively watching every gesture individually.", "2) Position driven analysis: In contrast, other participants focused entirely on the scatter points as template poses.", "Using expectations about possible behavior for a gesture proposal (e.g. left vs right hand throwing), they examined scatter points in those map regions that based on the landmark skeletons encoded related poses.", "8.2.2 Cluster Approaches.", "A difficulty with k-means is setting the number of clusters.", "As an example strategy, to detect the subgroup behavior for the throw ball referent, we quickly skimmed through the gestures using the map and visually identified rough patterns.", "We then chose

platforms to collect large datasets, we expect computational methods and visual analytics as proposed here to become indispensable tools for many future HCI studies.", "8.2.3 Feature Representation.",

improvements, visualization concepts could be explored to address this as well (e.g. visually mark jumps along the gesture path).", "8.3.4 Supporting Live Exploration and Monitoring.", "GestureMap could be extended to more than post-hoc analysis: For example, we could embed live sensor data and continuously update the underlying mode.", "This live embedding provides a monitoring tool, for example, for participants to see their currently performed gesture (e.g. shown as a cursor/point on the map), possibly to nudge them towards exploring new regions of the behavior space (cf.
